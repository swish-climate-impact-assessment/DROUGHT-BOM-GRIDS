ABSTRACT:
----
This is monthly drought data for Australia 1890-2008 using the Hutchinson Drought Index applied to Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) gridded weather data.  The source weather dataset is monthly interpolations of rainfall data 1890-2008 from BoM weather stations, gridded at 0.25 degree of latitude-longitude across Australia.

The algorithm used to calculate the drought index using the Hutchinson method is stored in this repository.  
The source weather data can be accessed from the principal investigators:  Peter Powers and Dean Collins, National Climate Centre, BoM.
